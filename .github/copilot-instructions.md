# GitHub Copilot Instructions for GPT-Prompt-Hub

## How to Use This Repository with GitHub Copilot

### 1. **Direct Prompt Integration**
Copy prompts from the `.md` files in this repository and paste them as comments in your code files to guide Copilot's suggestions.

### 2. **Available Prompts**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines for incremental, test-driven coding
- `American-Buddy-Language-Coach.md` - Language coaching and conversation prompts
- `Book-Recommendation-Expert.md` - Book recommendation system prompts

#### For Development Work:
```javascript
// Following CLAUDE.md guidelines: incremental progress, test-driven development
// Use composition over inheritance, explicit over implicit
// Write boring, obvious code with single responsibility
```

#### For Documentation:
```markdown
<!-- Use Book-Recommendation-Expert.md approach for content suggestions -->
<!-- Apply American-Buddy-Language-Coach.md for clear, helpful language -->
```

### 4. **Best Practices**
1. **Reference specific prompts** in your file comments
